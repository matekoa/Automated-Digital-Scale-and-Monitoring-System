This was a design group project. My role was to work on data capture, storage and monitoring (in the image above).

## Background
The task we were given was to design a solution to a problem identified through conversations with
stakeholders. The stakeholders included researchers at The Fitzpatrick Institute of Ornithology at the
University of Cape Town. The Fitzpatrick Institute does some of their research on birds in remote
locations, such as the Kalahari desert, and many other habitats - and commissioned the engineering
students to help enhance avian research and conservation efforts that are currently in place. Ornithology
encompasses the entirety of study areas focused on birds, including conservation, research, population
ecology, and more. Traditional data collection methods are falling through the cracks created by
modernisation and digitisation in recent years, and the goal of this project was to help create form-fitted
solutions that will last
